# Virtual Keyboard
This repository contains a virtual keyboard implementation using the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries. The virtual keyboard utilizes computer vision techniques to track hand movements and recognize gestures or finger positions for simulating typing on a keyboard without physical keys.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking using the MediaPipe hand detection module.
- Gesture recognition for various hand gestures or finger positions.
- Simulates key presses based on the recognized gestures.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) to display the virtual keyboard on the screen.
- Integration with OpenCV and MediaPipe for image processing and computer vision tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with the virtual keyboard, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/anil2k/virtual-keyboard.git`
2. Set up the required dependencies, including OpenCV and MediaPipe.
3. Run the `virtual_keyboard.py` script to start the virtual keyboard application.
```bash
python virtual_keyboard.py
5. Interact with the virtual keyboard by positioning your hand and making gestures to simulate key presses.

Refer to the project documentation for more detailed instructions on setup and usage.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV (version 4.7.0)
- MediaPipe (version 0.9.0.1)
- NumPy (version 1.19.5)
